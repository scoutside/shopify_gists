# Shopify Things and Stuff

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE.md)

Hopefully this can be a place where can place some reusable Shopify components.

The hope is that these libraries will be composable in some respect, and be devoid of any unnecessary classes and ids to avoid collisions and stylistic dependencies. Any javascript selectors should use data attributes. The goal is that these elements can be dropped into any Shopify theme.

## Usage

The repo is managed as a monorepo that is composed of many packages. 
Each package has its own `README` and documentation describing usage.
